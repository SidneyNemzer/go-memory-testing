-o format
      User-defined format.  format is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which
      offers a way to specify individual output columns.  The recognized keywords are described in the STANDARD FORMAT
      SPECIFIERS section below.  Headers may be renamed (ps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.  If all
      column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=) then the header line will not be output.  Column width will increase
      as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN
      -o comm).  Explicit width control (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies
      with personality; output may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple -o
      options when in doubt.  Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD
      are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or BSD columns.

drs         DRS       data resident set size, the amount of physical memory devoted to other than executable code.

rss         RSS       resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in kilobytes).  (alias
                      rssize, rsz).

trs         TRS       text resident set size, the amount of physical memory devoted to executable code.

vsz         VSZ       virtual memory size of the process in KiB (1024-byte units).  Device mappings are currently
                             excluded; this is subject to change.  (alias vsize).

comm        COMMAND   command name (only the executable name).  Modifications to the command name will not be shown.  A
                             process marked <defunct> is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.  The output in
                             this column may contain spaces.  (alias ucmd, ucomm).  See also the args format keyword, the -f
                             option, and the c option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If ps can not determine
                             display width, as when output is redirected (piped) into a file or another command, the output width
                             is undefined (it may be 80, unlimited, determined by the TERM variable, and so on).  The COLUMNS
                             environment variable or --cols option may be used to exactly determine the width in this case.  The
                             w or -w option may be also be used to adjust width.
